# Project Structure
This project is divided into three checkpoints:

Checkpoint 1: Understanding the Business Context and Define Metrics

Defining the Metrics:
Identifed Key Metrics: Determined which metrics are essential for assessing the performance of customer service operations. Considered metrics that can provide insights into how customer service impacts retention.
Metric Tree: Illustrated how the identified metrics relate to each other and to the overall business goal of improving customer retention.

Defineing the Hypotheses:
Formulated Hypotheses: Based on the business context and the identified metrics, developed hypotheses that can be tested using the provided data.

Example Hypotheses:
Reducing average response time will improve overall customer retention.
Enhancing customer service training to address negative sentiment will increase CSAT scores and retention.
Reducing average call duration through efficient processes will improve CSAT scores and retention.

Identifed Data Columns: Selected relevant columns from the dataset that will help in testing each hypothesis.

Checkpoint 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA for Each Hypothesis:
Data Import: Imported the customer call data into Excel.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.
Data Processing: Created new columns if necessary (e.g., extracting call date from call_timestamp).

Analysis:
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key metrics including mean, median, and standard deviation related to customer service and CSAT.
Correlation Analysis: Examination of key relationships between variables such as response time, CSAT score, and call center location.
Pivot Tables: Using of pivot tables to aggregate and summarize data based on dimensions like call center or sentiment.
Data Visualization: Created charts and graphs to visualize findings, such as trends in response times versus CSAT score.

Checkpoint 3: Build Dashboards

Created Interactive Dashboards:
Designed Dashboards: Developed interactive dashboards to present key insights related to customer service and retention. Included visualizations that allow users to explore data about response times, sentiment, and location in relation to CSAT scores.
Final Presentation:
Prepared Presentation/Document: Summarizing our findings, including insights from the EDA and the impact of customer service on retention.
Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer service and retention based on your analysis. For example, suggest strategies to reduce response times or enhance customer interaction based on sentiment analysis.
